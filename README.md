## üóÉÔ∏è Overview
Pathological examination is critical for disease diagnosis, with various staining techniques providing detailed visualization 
of tissue structures. While hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining remains predominant, the special stains, immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
and multiplex immunofluorescence (mpIF) provide valuable complementary information for comprehensive diagnosis. However, 
current multi-stain workflows are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and tissue-exhaustive, requiring either re-staining or 
additional tissue sectioning. To address these challenges, we propose StainExpert, a unified multimodal diffusion framework 
for source-to-multi-target pathological stain translation. Unlike existing approaches that require separate models for 
each staining pair, StainExpert establishes the first multi-expert system where specialized networks collaboratively 
learn staining principles while maintaining domain-specific expertise. Through multi-expert and multi-objective optimization, 
it enables efficient translation from a single source to multiple targets. Additionally, our multimodal diffusion architecture 
integrates textual guidance with visual features, achieving superior accuracy and pathology-informed translation. 
Leveraging parameter-efficient design and model distillation, StainExpert matches GAN-level efficiency while delivering 
superior generation quality. We validate StainExpert across three datasets spanning H&E, special stains, IHC, and mpIF 
modalities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that StainExpert generates high-quality virtual stains that preserve 
critical pathological features for accurate diagnosis. Beyond robust cross-domain generalization, StainExpert offers 
a transformative platform for efficient multi-target stain translation, advancing toward streamlined, tissue-conserving, 
and resource-efficient diagnostic workflows in computational pathology.

## üóÉÔ∏è Usage

### Preparation
1. Prepare the data (e.g. ANHIR-kidney)
    <details>
    <summary> assume the multi-stain dataset is in `/path/to/anhir-kidney`. It should be like this:</summary>

    ```
    /path/to/anhir-kidney/:
        train/:
            HE/: 
                HE_images_1.JPEG ...
                HE_images_2.JPEG ...
            MAS/:
                MAS_images_2.JPEG ...
                MAS_images_2.JPEG ...
            ... 

        test/:
            HE/: 
                HE_images_1.JPEG ...
            MAS/: 
                MAS_images_1.JPEG ...
            ...
       ```
   **NOTE: The arg `--data_path=/path/to/dataset` should be passed to the training script.**
    </details>

2. Train the StainExpert model<br/>
```bash
python train.py --data /path/to/anhir-kidney --experts 4 --topk 2 --step 100000
```
